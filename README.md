# Oh hey, didn't see you there!

#### Hi, I'm Nolan! 🥳
I'm an aspiring software developer based in BC, Canada. I specialize in front end web development, but like to do a little back end when I can to keep life exciting.

🎲 - I'm interested in game development, creative writting, running long distances, and generally creating cool things. I also try to play as much D&D as I possibly can.

🏫 - I'm a 2nd year student in the Computer Systems Technology diploma at BCIT, speciaizing in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I also love taking online courses about anything and everything that I find interesting.

💌 - If you'd like to reach out to me, shoot me an email at NolanNordwall@gmail.com.

Thanks for checking out my github! Let's build some radical stuff together!
