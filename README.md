# Oh hey, didn't see you there!

#### 🥳 Hi, I'm Nolan! 
I'm a junior software developer based in BC, Canada. I specialize in C++, and AI/ML

🎲 - I'm interested in game development, creative writting, running long distances, and generally creating cool things. I also try to play as much D&D as I possibly can.

🏫 - I graduated as Valedictorian from BCIT, in the Computer Systems Technology Diploma program

💌 - If you'd like to reach out to me, shoot me an email at NolanNordwall@gmail.com. You can also check out my previous work on my portfolio at https://softwaresorcerer.com/

Thanks for checking out my github! Let's build some radical stuff together!
